It is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by a Gram-negative bacterium derived from water lily, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Sphingomonaspaucimobilis), using small molecule carbohydrate such as glucose as a High acyl gellangum: The basic structure is a main chain, consisting of repeating tetrasaccharideunits, as shown in Figure 1a. In the natural form of this polysaccharide, there is one O-glycerol acyl substituent per unit and one O-acetyl substituent every other unit. This natural form of gellangum is called high acyl gellangum. The relative molecular weight is about 1 to 2 million. Low acyl gellangum: The acyl group is easily removed by alkali at high temperature, thus obtaining the deacylatedform from the natural form of gellangum,. We call it low acyl gellangum. The relative molecular weight is about 500,000.",
